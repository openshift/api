          IngressControllerConfig is the Custom Resource object which holds the current configuration of Ingress Controllers.
          This provides a cluster-level configuration API for managing ingress controller operational settings.

          Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.

                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.
