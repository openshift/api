              spec is the desired state of the ClusterCatalog.
              spec is required.
              The controller will work to ensure that the desired
              catalog is unpacked and served over the catalog content HTTP server.
            properties:
              availabilityMode:
                default: Available
                description: |-
                  availabilityMode allows users to define how the ClusterCatalog is made available to clients on the cluster.
                  availabilityMode is optional.

                  Allowed values are "Available" and "Unavailable" and omitted.

                  When omitted, the default value is "Available".

                  When set to "Available", the catalog contents will be unpacked and served over the catalog content HTTP server.
                  Setting the availabilityMode to "Available" tells clients that they should consider this ClusterCatalog
                  and its contents as usable.

                  When set to "Unavailable", the catalog contents will no longer be served over the catalog content HTTP server.
                  When set to this availabilityMode it should be interpreted the same as the ClusterCatalog not existing.
                  Setting the availabilityMode to "Unavailable" can be useful in scenarios where a user may not want
                  to delete the ClusterCatalog all together, but would still like it to be treated as if it doesn't exist.
                enum:
                - Unavailable
                - Available
                type: string

                description: |-
                  priority allows the user to define a priority for a ClusterCatalog.
                  priority is optional.

                  A ClusterCatalog's priority is used by clients as a tie-breaker between ClusterCatalogs that meet the client's requirements.
                  A higher number means higher priority.

                  It is up to clients to decide how to handle scenarios where multiple ClusterCatalogs with the same priority meet their requirements.
                  When deciding how to break the tie in this scenario, it is recommended that clients prompt their users for additional input.

                  When omitted, the default priority is 0 because that is the zero value of integers.

                  Negative numbers can be used to specify a priority lower than the default.
                  Positive numbers can be used to specify a priority higher than the default.

                  The lowest possible value is -2147483648.
                  The highest possible value is 2147483647.

              source:
                description: |-
                  source allows a user to define the source of a catalog.
                  A "catalog" contains information on content that can be installed on a cluster.
                  Providing a catalog source makes the contents of the catalog discoverable and usable by
                  other on-cluster components.
                  These on-cluster components may do a variety of things with this information, such as
                  presenting the content in a GUI dashboard or installing content from the catalog on the cluster.
                  The catalog source must contain catalog metadata in the File-Based Catalog (FBC) format.
                  For more information on FBC, see https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs/#docs.
                  source is a required field.

                  Below is a minimal example of a ClusterCatalogSpec that sources a catalog from an image:

                   source:
                     type: Image
                     image:
                       ref: quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest
                properties:
                  image:
                    description: |-
                      image is used to configure how catalog contents are sourced from an OCI image.
                      This field is required when type is Image, and forbidden otherwise.
                    properties:
                      pollIntervalMinutes:
                        description: |-
                          pollIntervalMinutes allows the user to set the interval, in minutes, at which the image source should be polled for new content.
                          pollIntervalMinutes is optional.
                          pollIntervalMinutes can not be specified when ref is a digest-based reference.

                          When omitted, the image will not be polled for new content.
                        minimum: 1
                        type: integer
                      ref:
                        description: |-
                          ref allows users to define the reference to a container image containing Catalog contents.
                          ref is required.
                          ref can not be more than 1000 characters.

                          A reference can be broken down into 3 parts - the domain, name, and identifier.

                          The domain is typically the registry where an image is located.
                          It must be alphanumeric characters (lowercase and uppercase) separated by the "." character.
                          Hyphenation is allowed, but the domain must start and end with alphanumeric characters.
                          Specifying a port to use is also allowed by adding the ":" character followed by numeric values.
                          The port must be the last value in the domain.
                          Some examples of valid domain values are "registry.mydomain.io", "quay.io", "my-registry.io:8080".

                          The name is typically the repository in the registry where an image is located.
                          It must contain lowercase alphanumeric characters separated only by the ".", "_", "__", "-" characters.
                          Multiple names can be concatenated with the "/" character.
                          The domain and name are combined using the "/" character.
                          Some examples of valid name values are "operatorhubio/catalog", "catalog", "my-catalog.prod".
                          An example of the domain and name parts of a reference being combined is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog".

                          The identifier is typically the tag or digest for an image reference and is present at the end of the reference.
                          It starts with a separator character used to distinguish the end of the name and beginning of the identifier.
                          For a digest-based reference, the "@" character is the separator.
                          For a tag-based reference, the ":" character is the separator.
                          An identifier is required in the reference.

                          Digest-based references must contain an algorithm reference immediately after the "@" separator.
                          The algorithm reference must be followed by the ":" character and an encoded string.
                          The algorithm must start with an uppercase or lowercase alpha character followed by alphanumeric characters and may contain the "-", "_", "+", and "." characters.
                          Some examples of valid algorithm values are "sha256", "sha256+b64u", "multihash+base58".
                          The encoded string following the algorithm must be hex digits (a-f, A-F, 0-9) and must be a minimum of 32 characters.

                          Tag-based references must begin with a word character (alphanumeric + "_") followed by word characters or ".", and "-" characters.
                          The tag must not be longer than 127 characters.

                          An example of a valid digest-based image reference is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog@sha256:200d4ddb2a73594b91358fe6397424e975205bfbe44614f5846033cad64b3f05"
                          An example of a valid tag-based image reference is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest"

                  The Serving condition is used to represent whether or not the contents of the catalog is being served via the HTTP(S) web server.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Available, the contents of the catalog are being served.

                  When it has a status of False and a reason of UserSpecifiedUnavailable, the contents of the catalog are not being served because the catalog has been intentionally marked as unavailable.

                  The Progressing condition is used to represent whether or not the ClusterCatalog is progressing or is ready to progress towards a new state.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Retrying, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that may be resolved on subsequent reconciliation attempts.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the ClusterCatalog has successfully progressed to a new state and is ready to continue progressing.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason of Blocked, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that requires manual intervention for recovery.
