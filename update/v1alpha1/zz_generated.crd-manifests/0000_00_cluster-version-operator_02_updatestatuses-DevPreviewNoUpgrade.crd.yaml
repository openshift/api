                            insights is a list of insights produced by this producer. Insights are units of information relevant to an update
                            progress or health information. There are two types of update insights: status insights and health insights. The
                            first type are directly tied to the update process, regardless of whether it is proceeding smoothly or not.

                            Status Insights expose the state of a single resource that is directly involved in the update process, usually a resource
                            that either has a notion of "being updated," (such as a Node or ClusterOperator) or represents a higher-level
                            abstraction (such as a ClusterVersion resource tahat represents the control plane or MachineConfigPool that represents
                            a pool of nodes).

                            Health Insights report a state or condition in the cluster that is abnormal or negative and either affects or is
                            affected by the update. Ideally, none would be generated in a standard healthy update. Health insights communicate
                            a condition that warrants attention by the cluster administrator.

                              insights is a list of insights produced by this producer. Insights are units of information relevant to an update
                              progress or health information. There are two types of update insights: status insights and health insights. The
                              first type are directly tied to the update process, regardless of whether it is proceeding smoothly or not.

                              Status Insights expose the state of a single resource that is directly involved in the update process, usually a resource
                              that either has a notion of "being updated," (such as a Node or ClusterOperator) or represents a higher-level
                              abstraction (such as a ClusterVersion resource tahat represents the control plane or MachineConfigPool that represents
                              a pool of nodes).

                              Health Insights report a state or condition in the cluster that is abnormal or negative and either affects or is
                              affected by the update. Ideally, none would be generated in a standard healthy update. Health insights communicate
                              a condition that warrants attention by the cluster administrator.
