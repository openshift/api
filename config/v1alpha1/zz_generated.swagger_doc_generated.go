Conflicts between the existing platform specific provider image match configuration and this list will be handled by the following precedence rule: credentials from built-in kubelet providers (e.g., ECR, GCR, ACR) take precedence over those from the CRIOCredentialProviderConfig when both match the same image. To avoid uncertainty, it is recommended to avoid configuring your private image patterns to overlap with existing platform specific provider config(e.g., the entries from https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/main/templates/common/aws/files/etc-kubernetes-credential-providers-ecr-credential-provider.yaml).

Each entry must be no longer than 512 characters. Wildcards ('*') are supported for full subdomain labels, such as '*.k8s.io' or 'k8s.*.io', and for top-level domains, such as 'k8s.*' (which matches 'k8s.io' or 'k8s.net'). A global wildcard '*' (matching any domain) is not allowed. Wildcards may replace an entire hostname label (e.g., *.example.com), but they cannot appear within a label (e.g., f*oo.example.com) and are not allowed in the port or path. For example, 'example.*.com' is valid, but 'exa*mple.*.com' is not. Each wildcard matches only a single domain label, so '*.io' does **not** match '*.k8s.io'.\n\nA match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true: Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches.

More general scopes are prefixes of individual-image scopes, and specify a repository (by omitting the tag or digest), a repository namespace, or a registry host (by only specifying the host name and possibly a port number) or a wildcard expression starting with `*.`, for matching all subdomains (not including a port number). Wildcards are only supported for subdomain matching, and may not be used in the middle of the host, i.e.  *.example.com is a valid case, but example*.*.com is not. If multiple scopes match a given image, only the policy requirements for the most specific scope apply. The policy requirements for more general scopes are ignored. In addition to setting a policy appropriate for your own deployed applications, make sure that a policy on the OpenShift image repositories quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release, quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev (or on a more general scope) allows deployment of the OpenShift images required for cluster operation. If a scope is configured in both the ClusterImagePolicy and the ImagePolicy, or if the scope in ImagePolicy is nested under one of the scopes from the ClusterImagePolicy, only the policy from the ClusterImagePolicy will be applied.
