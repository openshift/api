                  serviceAccountIssuer is the identifier of the bound service account token
                  issuer.
                  The default is https://kubernetes.default.svc
                  WARNING: Updating this field will not result in immediate invalidation of all bound tokens with the
                  previous issuer value. Instead, the tokens issued by previous service account issuer will continue to
                  be trusted for a time period chosen by the platform (currently set to 24h).
                  This time period is subject to change over time.
                  This allows internal components to transition to use new service account issuer without service distruption.
