                                MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                  provisioner.
                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:

                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            has a toleration, are included.
                            - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

                            If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

                            TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                            and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket.
                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                            And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                            WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                            the spread constraint.
                            - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                            - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                              but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                              skew.
                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                            "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.

                            MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                            spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                            to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                            for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                            MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                            Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                            be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                            This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket.
                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                            And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                            and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket.
                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                            And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                            WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                            the spread constraint.
                            - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                            - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                              but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                              skew.
                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                            "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                      Disabled disables monitoring for user-defined projects. This restricts the default monitoring stack, installed in the openshift-monitoring project, to monitor only platform namespaces, which prevents any custom monitoring configurations or resources from being applied to user-defined namespaces.
                      NamespaceIsolated enables monitoring for user-defined projects with namespace-scoped tenancy. This ensures that metrics, alerts, and monitoring data are isolated at the namespace level.
