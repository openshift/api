# etcd.openshift.io API Group

This API group contains CRDs related to etcd cluster management in Two Node OpenShift with Fencing deployments.

## API Versions

### v1alpha1

Contains the `PacemakerCluster` custom resource for monitoring Pacemaker cluster health in Two Node OpenShift with Fencing deployments.

#### PacemakerCluster

- **Feature Gate**: `DualReplica`
- **Component**: `two-node-fencing`
- **Scope**: Cluster-scoped singleton resource (must be named "cluster")
- **Resource Path**: `pacemakerclusters.etcd.openshift.io`

The `PacemakerCluster` resource provides visibility into the health and status of a Pacemaker-managed cluster.
It is periodically updated by the cluster-etcd-operator's status collector.

### Status Subresource Design

This resource uses the standard Kubernetes status subresource pattern (`+kubebuilder:subresource:status`).
The status collector creates the resource without status, then immediately populates it via the `/status` endpoint.

**Why not atomic create-with-status?**

We initially explored removing the status subresource to allow creating the resource with status in a single
atomic operation. This would ensure the resource is never observed in an incomplete state. However:

1. The Kubernetes API server strips the `status` field from create requests when a status subresource is enabled
2. Without the subresource, we cannot use separate RBAC for spec vs status updates
3. The OpenShift API test framework assumes status subresource exists for status update tests

The status collector performs a two-step operation: create resource, then immediately update status.
The brief window where status is empty is acceptable since the healthcheck controller handles missing status gracefully.

### Pacemaker Resources

A **pacemaker resource** is a unit of work managed by pacemaker. In pacemaker terminology, resources are services
or applications that pacemaker monitors, starts, stops, and moves between nodes to maintain high availability.
This is distinct from fencing agents and alert agents, which pacemaker does not manage as resources (see the
[Fencing Agents](#fencing-agents) and [Alert Agents](#alert-agents) sections below).

For Two Node OpenShift with Fencing, we manage two resource types:
- **Kubelet**: The Kubernetes node agent and a prerequisite for etcd
- **Etcd**: The distributed key-value store

Fencing agents and alert agents are tracked separately in each node's `fencingAgents` and `alertAgents`
arrays, not in `resources`.

            - type: Available   # Delivery chain (script, helper, systemd unit, sudoers) present on this node
        - name: UntaintAlertAgent
          conditions: [...]     # Same 3 conditions as TaintAlertAgent (abbreviated)
```

### Fencing Agents

Fencing agents are STONITH (Shoot The Other Node In The Head) devices used to isolate failed nodes.
Unlike regular pacemaker resources (Kubelet, Etcd), fencing agents are tracked separately because:

1. **Mapping by target, not schedule**: Resources are mapped to the node where they are scheduled to run.
   Fencing agents are mapped to the node they can *fence* (their target), regardless of which node
   their monitoring operations are scheduled on.

2. **Multiple agents per node**: A node can have multiple fencing agents for redundancy
   (e.g., both Redfish and IPMI). Expected: 1 per node, supported: up to 8.

3. **Health tracking via two node-level conditions**:
   - **FencingAvailable**: True if at least one agent is healthy (fencing works), False if all agents unhealthy (degrades operator)
   - **FencingHealthy**: True if all agents are healthy (ideal state), False if any agent is unhealthy (emits warning events)

### Alert Agents

Alert agents are pacemaker alert handlers used to automatically taint a node after it is fenced, and remove
that taint once the node rejoins the cluster. There are two known alert agents: `TaintAlertAgent` and
`UntaintAlertAgent`. Unlike a pacemaker resource, an alert agent lives in the CIB's `<alerts>` section, not
`<resources>`: pacemaker doesn't start, stop, monitor, or move it. Its delivery chain (script, helper
script, systemd unit, sudoers entry) is delivered to each node independently by MCO.

Alert agents are tracked in each node's `alertAgents` array, using the dedicated `PacemakerClusterAlertAgentStatus`
type. Each entry carries exactly 3 conditions:
- `Configured` - the alert agent is registered in the CIB as expected (same value on every node, since it's a single cluster-wide CIB entry)
- `Available` - the alert agent's delivery chain is present and executable on this node
- `Healthy` - aggregate of the two conditions above

Alert-agent health folds upward through an optional node-level `AlertAgentsHealthy` condition into `node.Healthy`
and `cluster.Healthy`, the same way `fencingAgents[].Healthy` folds into `FencingAvailable`/`FencingHealthy`.

The `alertAgents` field itself is optional: it is omitted by status collector versions
that predate alert-agent tracking, so it cannot be required without breaking status updates from
those collectors during an upgrade. For the same reason, `AlertAgentsHealthy` has no `MinItems` bump or
`self.exists()` rule backing it - it stays truly optional in the schema, while the cluster-etcd-operator
treats its absence strictly. Once a status collector reports `alertAgents` for a node, it may not be
removed on a later update, and if `alertAgents` is non-empty, both `TaintAlertAgent` and `UntaintAlertAgent`
must be present.

### Alert-Agent-Level Conditions

Each entry in the `alertAgents` array has the following 3 conditions.

| Condition | True | False | Unknown |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| `Healthy` | Alert agent is healthy (`AlertAgentHealthy`) | Alert agent has issues (`AlertAgentUnhealthy`) | - |
| `Configured` | Registered in the CIB as expected (`Configured`) | Not registered (`NotRegistered`) or misconfigured (`Misconfigured`) | Not yet observed (`Pending`) |
| `Available` | Delivery chain present on this node (`Available`) | Part of the chain missing (`Unavailable`) | Not yet observed (`Pending`) |

### Validation Rules

**Resource naming:**
- Resource name must be "cluster" (singleton)

**Node name validation:**
- Must be a lowercase RFC 1123 subdomain name
- Consists of lowercase alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.'
- Must start and end with an alphanumeric character
- Maximum 253 characters

**Node addresses:**
- Uses `PacemakerNodeAddress` type (similar to `corev1.NodeAddress` but with IP validation)
- Currently only `InternalIP` type is supported
- Pacemaker allows multiple addresses for Corosync communication between nodes (1-8 addresses)
- The first address in the list is used for IP-based peer URLs for etcd membership
- IP validation:
  - Must be a valid global unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address
  - Must be in canonical form (e.g., `192.168.1.1` not `192.168.001.001`, or `2001:db8::1` not `2001:0db8::1`)
  - Excludes loopback, link-local, and multicast addresses
  - Maximum length is 39 characters (full IPv6 address)

**Timestamp validation:**
- `lastUpdated` is required when status is present
- Once set, cannot be set to an earlier timestamp (validation uses `!has(oldSelf.lastUpdated)` to handle initial creation)
- Timestamps must always increase (prevents stale updates from overwriting newer data)

**Status fields:**
- `status` - Optional on creation (pointer type), populated via status subresource
- When status is present, `conditions`, `lastUpdated`, and `nodes` are required:
  - `conditions` - Required array of cluster conditions (min 3 items: Healthy, InService, NodeCountAsExpected)
  - `lastUpdated` - Required timestamp for staleness detection
  - `nodes` - Required array of control-plane node statuses (min 0, max 5; empty allowed for catastrophic failures)

**Node fields (when node present):**
- `nodeName` - Required, RFC 1123 subdomain
- `addresses` - Required (min 1, max 8 items)
- `conditions` - Required (min 9 items with specific types enforced via XValidation)
- `resources` - Required (min 2 items: Kubelet and Etcd)
- `fencingAgents` - Required (min 1, max 8 items)
- `alertAgents` - Optional (0 or 2 items); omitted by status collectors that predate alert-agent tracking; once present, may not be removed; when non-empty, both `TaintAlertAgent` and `UntaintAlertAgent` are required

**Conditions validation:**
- Cluster-level: MinItems=3 (Healthy, InService, NodeCountAsExpected)
- Node-level: MinItems=9 (Healthy, Online, InService, Active, Ready, Clean, Member, FencingAvailable, FencingHealthy); an optional 10th, AlertAgentsHealthy, is not required
- Resource-level: MinItems=8 (Healthy, InService, Managed, Enabled, Operational, Active, Started, Schedulable)
- Fencing agent-level: MinItems=8 (same conditions as resources)
- Alert-agent-level: MinItems=3 (Healthy, Configured, Available)

All condition arrays have XValidation rules to ensure specific condition types are present.

**Resource names:**
- Valid values are: `Kubelet`, `Etcd`
- Both resources must be present in each node's `resources` array

**Alert agent names:**
- Valid values are: `TaintAlertAgent`, `UntaintAlertAgent`
- The `alertAgents` array itself is optional and may be empty or omitted
- If `alertAgents` is non-empty, both `TaintAlertAgent` and `UntaintAlertAgent` must be present (enforced via XValidation)
- Names must be unique within the `alertAgents` array (enforced via the `name` list-map key)
- Once `alertAgents` is reported for a node, it may not be removed on a later update (enforced via XValidation on `PacemakerClusterNodeStatus`)

**Fencing agent fields:**
- `name`: Unique identifier for the fencing agent (e.g., "master-0_redfish")
  - Must be unique within the `fencingAgents` array
  - May contain alphanumeric characters, dots, hyphens, and underscores (`^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`)
  - Maximum 300 characters (provides headroom beyond 253 node name + underscore + method)
- `method`: Fencing method enum - valid values are `Redfish` or `IPMI`
- `conditions`: Required, same 8 conditions as resources

Note: The target node is implied by the parent `PacemakerClusterNodeStatus` - fencing agents are nested under the node they can fence.

### Usage

The cluster-etcd-operator healthcheck controller watches this resource and updates operator conditions based on
the cluster state. The aggregate `Healthy` conditions at each level (cluster, node, resource) provide a quick
way to determine overall health.
