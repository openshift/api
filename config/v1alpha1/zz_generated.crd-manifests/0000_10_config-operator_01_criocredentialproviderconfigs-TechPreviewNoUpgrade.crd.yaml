          CRIOCredentialProviderConfig holds cluster-wide configurations for CRI-O credential provider. CRI-O credential provider is a binary shipped with CRI-O that provides a way to obtain container image pull credentials from external sources.
          For example, it can be used to fetch mirror registry credentials from secrets resources in the cluster within the same namespace the pod will be running in.
          CRIOCredentialProviderConfig configuration specifies the pod image sources registries that should trigger the CRI-O credential provider execution, which will resolve the CRI-O mirror configurations and obtain the necessary credentials for pod creation.

          Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.

              matchImages:
                description: |-
                  matchImages is a required list of string patterns used to determine whether
                  the CRI-O credential provider should be invoked for a given image. This list is
                  passed to the kubelet CredentialProviderConfig, and if any pattern matches
                  the requested image, CRI-O credential provider will be invoked to obtain credentials for pulling
                  that image or its mirrors.

                  For more details, see:
                  - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-credential-provider/
                  - https://github.com/cri-o/crio-credential-provider#architecture

                  Each entry in matchImages is a pattern which can optionally contain a port and a path.
                  Wildcards ('*') are supported for full subdomain labels, such as '*.k8s.io' or 'k8s.*.io',
                  and for top-level domains, such as 'k8s.*' (which matches 'k8s.io' or 'k8s.net').
                  Wildcards are not allowed in the port or path, nor may they appear in the middle of a hostname label.
                  For example, '*.example.com' is valid, but 'example*.*.com' is not.
                  Each wildcard matches only a single domain label,
                  so '*.io' does **not** match '*.k8s.io'.

                  A match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true:
                  - Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches.
                  - The URL path of an matchImages must be a prefix of the target image URL path.
                  - If the matchImages contains a port, then the port must match in the image as well.

                  Example values of matchImages:
                  - 123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
                  - *.azurecr.io
