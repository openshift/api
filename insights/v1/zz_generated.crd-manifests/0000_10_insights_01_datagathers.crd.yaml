                  The current condition types are DataUploaded, DataRecorded, DataProcessed, RemoteConfigurationNotAvailable, RemoteConfigurationInvalid

                  The DataUploaded condition is used to represent whether or not the archive was successfully uploaded for further processing.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the archive was successfully uploaded.
                  When it has a status of Unknown and a reason of NoUploadYet, the upload has not occurred, or there was no data to upload.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason Failed, the upload failed. The accompanying message will include the specific error encountered.

                  The DataRecorded condition is used to represent whether or not the archive was successfully recorded.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the archive was recorded successfully.
                  When it has a status of Unknown and a reason of NoDataGatheringYet, the data gathering process has not started yet.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason of RecordingFailed, the recording failed and a message will include the specific error encountered.

                  The DataProcessed condition is used to represent whether or not the archive was processed by the processing service.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Processed, the data was processed successfully.
                  When it has a status of Unknown and a reason of NothingToProcessYet, there is no data to process at the moment.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason of Failure, processing failed and a message will include the specific error encountered.

                  The RemoteConfigurationAvailable condition is used to represent whether the remote configuration is available.
                  When it has a status of Unknown and a reason of Unknown or RemoteConfigNotRequestedYet, the state of the remote configuration is unknown—typically at startup.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the configuration is available.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason of NoToken, the configuration was disabled by removing the cloud.openshift.com field from the pull secret.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason of DisabledByConfiguration, the configuration was disabled in insightsdatagather.config.openshift.io.

                  The RemoteConfigurationValid condition is used to represent whether the remote configuration is valid.
                  When it has a status of Unknown and a reason of Unknown or NoValidationYet, the validity of the remote configuration is unknown—typically at startup.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the configuration is valid.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason of Invalid, the configuration is invalid.

                  The Progressing condition is used to represent the phase of gathering
                  When it has a status of False and the reason is DataGatherPending, the gathering has not started yet.
                  When it has a status of True and reason is Gathering, the gathering is running.
                  When it has a status of False and reason is GatheringSucceeded, the gathering successfully finished.
                  When it has a status of False and reason is GatheringFailed, the gathering failed.
