# Output Format Requirements
You MUST use this EXACT format for ALL review feedback:


+LineNumber: Brief description
**Current (problematic) code:**
```go
[exact code from the PR diff]
```

**Suggested change:**
```diff
- [old code line]
+ [new code line]
```

**Explanation:** [Why this change is needed]


I'll run a comprehensive API review for OpenShift API changes. This can review either a specific GitHub PR or local changes against upstream master.

## API Conventions

**CRITICAL**: All API changes MUST comply with both Kubernetes and OpenShift API conventions:

1. **Kubernetes API Conventions**: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md
2. **OpenShift API Conventions**: https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/dev-guide/api-conventions.md

**Naming Conventions**: All new fields MUST adhere to OpenShift and Kubernetes naming conventions to avoid conflicts now or in the future. Field names in golang must be PascalCase while their JSON representation has to be camelCase. They have to be descriptive, and align with established patterns in both Kubernetes and OpenShift APIs.

Before starting the review, I will fetch and review the latest API conventions from both sources to ensure all validation checks are aligned with current requirements.

## Step 1: Pre-flight checks and determine review mode

First, I'll check the arguments and determine whether to review a PR or local changes:

```bash
# Save current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "üìç Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Check if a PR URL was provided
if [ -n "$ARGUMENTS" ] && [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ github\.com.*pull ]]; then
    REVIEW_MODE="pr"
    PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
    echo "üîç PR review mode: Reviewing PR #$PR_NUMBER"

    # For PR review, check for uncommitted changes
    if ! git diff --quiet || ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
        echo "‚ùå ERROR: Uncommitted changes detected. Cannot proceed with PR review."
        echo "Please commit or stash your changes before running the API review."
        git status --porcelain
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ No uncommitted changes detected. Safe to proceed with PR review."
else
    REVIEW_MODE="local"
    echo "üîç Local review mode: Reviewing local changes against upstream master"

    # Find a remote pointing to openshift/api repository
    OPENSHIFT_REMOTE=""
    for remote in $(git remote); do
        remote_url=$(git remote get-url "$remote" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
        if [[ "$remote_url" =~ github\.com[/:]openshift/api(\.git)?$ ]]; then
            OPENSHIFT_REMOTE="$remote"
            echo "‚úÖ Found OpenShift API remote: '$remote' -> $remote_url"
            break
        fi
    done

    # If no existing remote found, add upstream
    if [ -z "$OPENSHIFT_REMOTE" ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No remote pointing to openshift/api found. Adding upstream remote..."
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/openshift/api.git
        OPENSHIFT_REMOTE="upstream"
    fi

    # Fetch latest changes from the OpenShift API remote
    echo "üîÑ Fetching latest changes from $OPENSHIFT_REMOTE..."
    git fetch "$OPENSHIFT_REMOTE" master
fi
```

## Step 2: Get changed files based on review mode

```bash
if [ "$REVIEW_MODE" = "pr" ]; then
    # PR Review: Checkout the PR and get changed files
    echo "üîÑ Checking out PR #$PR_NUMBER..."
    gh pr checkout "$PR_NUMBER"

    echo "üìÅ Analyzing changed files in PR..."
    CHANGED_FILES=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json files --jq '.files[].path' | grep '\.go$' | grep -E '/(v1|v1alpha1|v1beta1)/')
else
    # Local Review: Get changed files compared to openshift remote master
    echo "üìÅ Analyzing locally changed files compared to $OPENSHIFT_REMOTE/master..."
    CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only "$OPENSHIFT_REMOTE/master...HEAD" | grep '\.go$' | grep -E '/(v1|v1alpha1|v1beta1)/')

    # Also include staged changes
    STAGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep '\.go$' | grep -E '/(v1|v1alpha1|v1beta1)/' || true)
    if [ -n "$STAGED_FILES" ]; then
        CHANGED_FILES=$(echo -e "$CHANGED_FILES\n$STAGED_FILES" | sort -u)
    fi
fi

echo "Changed API files:"
echo "$CHANGED_FILES"

if [ -z "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
    echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è  No API files changed. Nothing to review."
    if [ "$REVIEW_MODE" = "pr" ]; then
        git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
    fi
    exit 0
fi
```

## Step 3: Run linting checks on changes

```bash
echo "‚è≥ Running linting checks on changes..."
make lint

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Linting checks failed. Please fix the issues before proceeding."
    if [ "$REVIEW_MODE" = "pr" ]; then
        echo "üîÑ Switching back to original branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
        git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
    fi
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Linting checks passed."
```

## Step 4: Documentation and API conventions validation

For each changed API file, I'll validate:

1. **Kubernetes API Conventions**: All changes must comply with https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md
2. **OpenShift API Conventions**: All changes must comply with https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/dev-guide/api-conventions.md
3. **Field Naming Conventions**: All new fields must adhere to OpenShift and Kubernetes naming conventions to avoid conflicts now or in the future
4. **Field Documentation**: All struct fields must have documentation comments
5. **Optional Field Behavior**: Optional fields must explain what happens when they are omitted
6. **Validation Documentation**: Validation rules must be documented and match markers
7. **Cross-field Validation**: Documented field relationships must have corresponding XValidation rules

Let me check each changed file for these requirements:

```thinking
I need to analyze the changed files to:
1. Find struct fields without documentation
2. Find optional fields without behavior documentation
3. Find validation annotations without corresponding documentation

For each Go file, I'll:
- Look for struct field definitions
- Check if they have preceding comment documentation
- For optional fields (those with `+kubebuilder:validation:Optional` or `+optional`), verify behavior is explained
- For fields with validation annotations, ensure the validation is documented
```

## Step 5: Generate comprehensive review report

I'll provide a comprehensive report showing:
- ‚úÖ Files that pass all checks
- ‚ùå Files with documentation issues
- üìã Specific lines that need attention
- üìö Guidance on fixing any issues

The review will fail if any documentation requirements are not met for the changed files.

## Step 6: Switch back to original branch (PR mode only)

After completing the review, if we were reviewing a PR, I'll switch back to the original branch:

```bash
if [ "$REVIEW_MODE" = "pr" ]; then
    echo "üîÑ Switching back to original branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
    git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
    echo "‚úÖ API review complete. Back on branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
else
    echo "‚úÖ Local API review complete."
fi
```

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS:**

**For PR Review Mode:**
1. MUST check for uncommitted changes before starting
2. MUST abort if uncommitted changes are detected
3. MUST save current branch name before switching
4. MUST checkout the PR before running `make lint`
5. MUST switch back to original branch when complete
6. If any step fails, MUST attempt to switch back to original branch before exiting

**For Local Review Mode:**
1. MUST detect existing remotes pointing to openshift/api repository (supports any remote name)
2. MUST add upstream remote only if no existing openshift/api remote is found
3. MUST fetch latest changes from the detected openshift/api remote
4. MUST compare against the detected remote's master branch
5. MUST include both committed and staged changes in analysis
6. No branch switching required since we're reviewing local changes
