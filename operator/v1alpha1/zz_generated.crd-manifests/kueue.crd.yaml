                      Gang Scheduling is the act of all or nothing scheduling,
                      where workloads do not become ready within a certain period, they may be evicted and later retried.
                      This field is optional.

                              Allowed values are Sequential and Parallel.
                              When admission is set to Sequential, only pods from the currently processing workload will be admitted.
                              Once all pods from the current workload are admitted, and ready, Kueue will process the next workload.
                              Sequential processing may slow down admission when the cluster has sufficient capacity for multiple workloads,
                              but provides a higher guarantee of workloads scheduling all pods together successfully.
                              When set to Parallel, pods from any workload will be admitted at any time.
                              This may lead to a deadlock where workloads are in contention for cluster capacity and
                              pods from another workload having successfully scheduled prevent pods from the current workload scheduling.

                          FairSharing means that ClusterQueues with pending Workloads can preempt other Workloads

                      Workloads that are missing the queue-name will be ignored by Kueue.
                      This field is optional.
                      If this field is not specified, Kueue will only manage workloads

                          The allowed values are QueueName and None.
                          None means that workloads will be suspended on

                          This will be applied for all integrations that Kueue manages.
                          QueueName means that workloads that are managed
                          by Kueue must have a label kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name.
                          If this label is not present on the workload, then Kueue will
                          ignore this workload.
