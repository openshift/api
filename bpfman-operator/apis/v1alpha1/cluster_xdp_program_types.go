	// added or removed from the list at any point, causing the XDP program to be
	// attached or detached.
	//
	// The attachment point for an XDP program is a network interface (or device).
	// The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
	// interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
	// bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node. Optionally, the
