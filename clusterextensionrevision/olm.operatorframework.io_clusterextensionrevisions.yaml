          ClusterExtensionRevision represents an immutable snapshot of Kubernetes objects
          for a specific version of a ClusterExtension. Each revision contains objects
          organized into phases that roll out sequentially. The same object can only be managed by a single revision
          at a time. Ownership of objects is transitioned from one revision to the next as the extension is upgraded
          or reconfigured. Once the latest revision has rolled out successfully, previous active revisions are archived for
          posterity.

                    - publish: Ingress, APIService, Route, Webhook objects

                  All objects in a phase are applied in no particular order.
                  The revision progresses to the next phase only after all objects in the current phase pass their readiness probes.

                              that already exist on the cluster.

                              When set to "Prevent" (the default), the operator only manages objects it created itself.
                              This prevents ownership collisions.

                              When set to "IfNoController", the operator can adopt and modify pre-existing objects
                              that are not owned by another controller.
                              This is useful for taking over management of manually-created resources.

                              When set to "None", the operator can adopt and modify any pre-existing object, even if
                              owned by another controller.
                              Use this setting with extreme caution as it may cause multiple controllers to fight over
                              the same resource, resulting in increased load on the API server and etcd.

                  The Progressing condition represents whether the revision is actively rolling out:
                    - When status is True and reason is RollingOut, the ClusterExtensionRevision rollout is actively making progress and is in transition.
                    - When status is True and reason is Retrying, the ClusterExtensionRevision has encountered an error that could be resolved on subsequent reconciliation attempts.

                    - When status is False and reason is Blocked, the ClusterExtensionRevision has encountered an error that requires manual intervention for recovery.
                    - When status is False and reason is Archived, the ClusterExtensionRevision is archived and not being actively reconciled.

                  The Available condition represents whether the revision has been successfully rolled out and is available:
                    - When status is True and reason is ProbesSucceeded, the ClusterExtensionRevision has been successfully rolled out and all objects pass their readiness probes.
                    - When status is False and reason is ProbeFailure, one or more objects are failing their readiness probes during rollout.
                    - When status is Unknown and reason is Reconciling, the ClusterExtensionRevision has encountered an error that prevented it from observing the probes.
                    - When status is Unknown and reason is Archived, the ClusterExtensionRevision has been archived and its objects have been torn down.
                    - When status is Unknown and reason is Migrated, the ClusterExtensionRevision was migrated from an existing release and object status probe results have not yet been observed.

                  The Succeeded condition represents whether the revision has successfully completed its rollout:
                    - When status is True and reason is Succeeded, the ClusterExtensionRevision has successfully completed its rollout. This condition is set once and persists even if the revision later becomes unavailable.
