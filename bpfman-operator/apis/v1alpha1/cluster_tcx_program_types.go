	// when the BPF Application CRD is created and the selected Kubernetes nodes
	// are active. The TCX program will not be triggered until the program has also
	// been attached to an attachment point described in this list. Items may be
	// added or removed from the list at any point, causing the TCX program to be
	// attached or detached.
	//
	// The attachment point for a TCX program is a network interface (or device).
	// The interface can be specified by name, by allowing bpfman to discover each
	// interface, or by setting the primaryNodeInterface flag, which instructs
	// bpfman to use the primary interface of a Kubernetes node. Optionally, the
	// TCX program can also be installed into a set of network namespaces.
